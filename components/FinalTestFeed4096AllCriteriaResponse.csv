"### Instruction: You are a diligent grading assistant for a Computer Science teacher. Your task is to read and analyze the Python code between <code> and </code> tags. Evaluate the code according to the criteria provided between <criteria> and </criteria> tags. Before evaluating, carefully review the CodeDescription provided between <description> and </description> tags to understand the purpose and context of the project. For each criterion, always assess the logic of the code, even if it does not run or contains errors, and provide both a score and detailed feedback explaining the reason for that score. After addressing all criteria, conclude by listing all individual scores in a summary. Ensure your feedback is thorough and covers any key points or potential improvements relevant to each criterion.

### CodeDescription: 
<description>
Recommendation apps: This is a list of many different kinds of projects that would involve recommending something to the user. Each of the recommendation app must have a set number of times the user must train the app by answering a list of questions. Then, based on those answers, the program should start recommending to the user from a menu of options. For example, a movie recommendation app would ask some questions like Do you like horror movies? and so on, then store the answers in a file for the user. After this training, the user may choose from some options of what recommendation they would like (a short movie, a TV show, an award-winning movie etc.. you can decide the menu that you offer to the user), then, depending on what the user chooses from your menu, you recommend a name of a movie. In the same way, you can also build a recommendation app for other things. To make it more realistic, you may get data from online sources for any of your recommendation apps.

### Criteria_1:
<criteria>
Description: Does the code contain branching statements and loops (as needed)? Branching using if-else and loops for repetitive execution of tasks are two of the most central elements of any Python code. So, all project code submissions must contain at least one if statement and one for / while statement.	
- 15 pts: Full points If the criteria is satisfied.
-10 pts: Partial points If the code contains only one of the two required components (if OR for/while)
-0 pts: No points
</criteria>

### Criteria_2:
<criteria>
Description: Does the Python code contain functions to create modular code? Functions are important to create modular tasks to reduce the redundancy in the code and for independent testing.	
- 10 pts: Full points If the code contains at least one function that is properly formatted and makes sense for the project.	
- 5 pts: Partial points If the code contains improper use of functions (or modular code is clear from files or other means).
- 0 pts: No points		
</criteria>

### Criteria_3:
<criteria>
Description: Data structures: Does the code use data structures as appropriate? Data structures discussed in the course are: strings, lists, and dictionaries. Grade whether the data structure that the code used is appropriate for that application. That is, if something has a key and a value, a dictionary is more appropriate than managing two lists. Similarly, if many variables are created instead of using a list, then it's improper code writing.
- 5 pts: Full points
- 0: pts No points
</criteria>

### Criteria_4:
<criteria>
Description: Does the code use files for reading or writing or any other advanced feature? If files are not applicable for the project, this criteria may be satisfied by graph generation, modules, python files, or other advanced features too.	
- 10 pts: Full points If file reading or other alternative advanced feature (like multiple modules, graphing, data analysis) is used appropriately in the code.
- 5 pts: Partial points Attempted to use files or other advanced feature but improper use/did not succeed fully.
- 0 pts: No points	
</criteria>

### Criteria_5:
<criteria>
Description: Is the code properly documented? Comments on key lines in the code and/or docstrings for functions.
- 5 pts: Full points if at least 5 commented lines or other text is present in the code
- 0 pts: No points If no comments or docstrings are provided.	
</criteria>

### Criteria_6:
<criteria>
Description: Did the code demonstrate most of the proposed features as written in the project ideas document? If most of the features are not demonstrated, check whether other equivalent (or new) features were implemented.	
- 25 pts: Full points If most of the features are successfully demonstrated (as seen from the code and its execution)
- 20 pts: Almost all features Almost all of the features for the project are demonstrated successfully.
- 15 pts: Half partial points Half of the proposed features are demonstrated successfully or some features are incorrectly implemented. The code implements a very basic set of features of the project.
- 10 pts: Partial points If only one feature is implemented and/or project is not significant work.
- 0 pts: No Marks
</criteria>

### Criteria_7:
<criteria>
Description: User-friendly interface Does the code create an interface for the user that is easy to use and friendly.	
- 10 pts: Full points
- 5 pts: Partial points If some user-messages are unhelpful
- 0 pts: No Marks
</criteria>

### CodeDescription: 
<description>
The goal is to simulate stress-strain curves for different materials. You would implement Hooke's Law and other stress-strain relationships in Python for conditions like tensile, compressive, and shear stresses. You could explore how different materials react to stress, and you could extend this by introducing fatigue analysis. Outputs could include plotted stress-strain curves and a report generated in a text file. (Use Matplotlib for visual)

"### Instruction: You are a diligent grading assistant for a Computer Science teacher. Your task is to read and analyze the Python code between <code> and </code> tags. Evaluate the code according to the criteria provided between <criteria> and </criteria> tags. Before evaluating, carefully review the CodeDescription provided between <description> and </description> tags to understand the purpose and context of the project. For each criterion, always assess the logic of the code, even if it does not run or contains errors, and provide both a score and detailed feedback explaining the reason for that score. After addressing all criteria, conclude by listing all individual scores in a summary. Ensure your feedback is thorough and covers any key points or potential improvements relevant to each criterion.

### CodeDescription: 
<description>
The project consists of asking the user for their type of engine and the liters of the engine.Will also have the option of letting users just input the name of the car as well. The user will then provide the number of miles that their trip is going to require and will output the amount of gas needed for that trip.
</description>

### Criteria_1:
<criteria>
Description: Does the code contain branching statements and loops (as needed)? Branching using if-else and loops for repetitive execution of tasks are two of the most central elements of any Python code. So, all project code submissions must contain at least one if statement and one for / while statement.	
- 15 pts: Full points If the criteria is satisfied.
-10 pts: Partial points If the code contains only one of the two required components (if OR for/while)
-0 pts: No points
</criteria>

### Criteria_2:
<criteria>
Description: Does the Python code contain functions to create modular code? Functions are important to create modular tasks to reduce the redundancy in the code and for independent testing.	
- 10 pts: Full points If the code contains at least one function that is properly formatted and makes sense for the project.	
- 5 pts: Partial points If the code contains improper use of functions (or modular code is clear from files or other means).
- 0 pts: No points		
</criteria>

### Criteria_3:
<criteria>
Description: Data structures: Does the code use data structures as appropriate? Data structures discussed in the course are: strings, lists, and dictionaries. Grade whether the data structure that the code used is appropriate for that application. That is, if something has a key and a value, a dictionary is more appropriate than managing two lists. Similarly, if many variables are created instead of using a list, then it's improper code writing.
- 5 pts: Full points
- 0: pts No points
</criteria>

### Criteria_4:
<criteria>
Description: Does the code use files for reading or writing or any other advanced feature? If files are not applicable for the project, this criteria may be satisfied by graph generation, modules, python files, or other advanced features too.	
- 10 pts: Full points If file reading or other alternative advanced feature (like multiple modules, graphing, data analysis) is used appropriately in the code.
- 5 pts: Partial points Attempted to use files or other advanced feature but improper use/did not succeed fully.
- 0 pts: No points	
</criteria>

### Criteria_5:
<criteria>
Description: Is the code properly documented? Comments on key lines in the code and/or docstrings for functions.
- 5 pts: Full points if at least 5 commented lines or other text is present in the code
- 0 pts: No points If no comments or docstrings are provided.	
</criteria>

### Criteria_6:
<criteria>
Description: Did the code demonstrate most of the proposed features as written in the project ideas document? If most of the features are not demonstrated, check whether other equivalent (or new) features were implemented.	
- 25 pts: Full points If most of the features are successfully demonstrated (as seen from the code and its execution)
- 20 pts: Almost all features Almost all of the features for the project are demonstrated successfully.
- 15 pts: Half partial points Half of the proposed features are demonstrated successfully or some features are incorrectly implemented. The code implements a very basic set of features of the project.
- 10 pts: Partial points If only one feature is implemented and/or project is not significant work.
- 0 pts: No Marks
</criteria>

### Criteria_7:
<criteria>
Description: User-friendly interface Does the code create an interface for the user that is easy to use and friendly.

"### Instruction: You are a diligent grading assistant for a Computer Science teacher. Your task is to read and analyze the Python code between <code> and </code> tags. Evaluate the code according to the criteria provided between <criteria> and </criteria> tags. Before evaluating, carefully review the CodeDescription provided between <description> and </description> tags to understand the purpose and context of the project. For each criterion, always assess the logic of the code, even if it does not run or contains errors, and provide both a score and detailed feedback explaining the reason for that score. After addressing all criteria, conclude by listing all individual scores in a summary. Ensure your feedback is thorough and covers any key points or potential improvements relevant to each criterion.

### CodeDescription: 
<description>
Recommendation apps: This is a list of many different kinds of projects that would involve recommending something to the user. Each of the recommendation app must have a set number of times the user must train the app by answering a list of questions. Then, based on those answers, the program should start recommending to the user from a menu of options. For example, a movie recommendation app would ask some questions like Do you like horror movies? and so on, then store the answers in a file for the user. After this training, the user may choose from some options of what recommendation they would like (a short movie, a TV show, an award-winning movie etc.. you can decide the menu that you offer to the user), then, depending on what the user chooses from your menu, you recommend a name of a movie. In the same way, you can also build a recommendation app for other things. To make it more realistic, you may get data from online sources for any of your recommendation apps.
</description>

### Criteria_1:
<criteria>
Description: Does the code contain branching statements and loops (as needed)? Branching using if-else and loops for repetitive execution of tasks are two of the most central elements of any Python code. So, all project code submissions must contain at least one if statement and one for / while statement.	
- 15 pts: Full points If the criteria is satisfied.
-10 pts: Partial points If the code contains only one of the two required components (if OR for/while)
-0 pts: No points
</criteria>

### Criteria_2:
<criteria>
Description: Does the Python code contain functions to create modular code? Functions are important to create modular tasks to reduce the redundancy in the code and for independent testing.	
- 10 pts: Full points If the code contains at least one function that is properly formatted and makes sense for the project.	
- 5 pts: Partial points If the code contains improper use of functions (or modular code is clear from files or other means).
- 0 pts: No points		
</criteria>

### Criteria_3:
<criteria>
Description: Data structures: Does the code use data structures as appropriate? Data structures discussed in the course are: strings, lists, and dictionaries. Grade whether the data structure that the code used is appropriate for that application. That is, if something has a key and a value, a dictionary is more appropriate than managing two lists. Similarly, if many variables are created instead of using a list, then it's improper code writing.
- 5 pts: Full points
- 0: pts No points
</criteria>

### Criteria_4:
<criteria>
Description: Does the code use files for reading or writing or any other advanced feature? If files are not applicable for the project, this criteria may be satisfied by graph generation, modules, python files, or other advanced features too.	
- 10 pts: Full points If file reading or other alternative advanced feature (like multiple modules, graphing, data analysis) is used appropriately in the code.
- 5 pts: Partial points Attempted to use files or other advanced feature but improper use/did not succeed fully.
- 0 pts: No points	
</criteria>

### Criteria_5:
<criteria>
Description: Is the code properly documented? Comments on key lines in the code and/or docstrings for functions.
- 5 pts: Full points if at least 5 commented lines or other text is present in the code
- 0 pts: No points If no comments or docstrings are provided.	
</criteria>

### Criteria_6:
<criteria>
Description: Did the code demonstrate most of the proposed features as written in the project ideas document? If most of the features are not demonstrated, check whether other equivalent (or new) features were implemented.	
- 25 pts: Full points If most of the features are successfully demonstrated (as seen from the code and its execution)
- 20 pts: Almost all features Almost all of the features for the project are demonstrated successfully.
- 15 pts: Half partial points Half of the proposed features are demonstrated successfully or some features are incorrectly implemented. The code implements a very basic set of features of the project.
- 10 pts: Partial points If only one feature is implemented and/or project is not significant work.
- 0 pts: No Marks
</criteria>

### Criteria_7:
<criteria>
Description: User-friendly interface Does the code create an interface for the user that is easy to use and friendly.	
- 10 pts: Full points
- 5 pts: Partial points If some user-messages are unhelpful
- 0 pts: No Marks
</criteria>

"### Instruction: You are a diligent grading assistant for a Computer Science teacher. Your task is to read and analyze the Python code between <code> and </code> tags. Evaluate the code according to the criteria provided between <criteria> and </criteria> tags. Before evaluating, carefully review the CodeDescription provided between <description> and </description> tags to understand the purpose and context of the project. For each criterion, always assess the logic of the code, even if it does not run or contains errors, and provide both a score and detailed feedback explaining the reason for that score. After addressing all criteria, conclude by listing all individual scores in a summary. Ensure your feedback is thorough and covers any key points or potential improvements relevant to each criterion.

### CodeDescription: 
<description>
Game where you try to roll higher than the computer.
</description>

### Criteria_1:
<criteria>
Description: Does the code contain branching statements and loops (as needed)? Branching using if-else and loops for repetitive execution of tasks are two of the most central elements of any Python code. So, all project code submissions must contain at least one if statement and one for / while statement.	
- 15 pts: Full points If the criteria is satisfied.
-10 pts: Partial points If the code contains only one of the two required components (if OR for/while)
-0 pts: No points
</criteria>

### Criteria_2:
<criteria>
Description: Does the Python code contain functions to create modular code? Functions are important to create modular tasks to reduce the redundancy in the code and for independent testing.	
- 10 pts: Full points If the code contains at least one function that is properly formatted and makes sense for the project.	
- 5 pts: Partial points If the code contains improper use of functions (or modular code is clear from files or other means).
- 0 pts: No points		
</criteria>

### Criteria_3:
<criteria>
Description: Data structures: Does the code use data structures as appropriate? Data structures discussed in the course are: strings, lists, and dictionaries. Grade whether the data structure that the code used is appropriate for that application. That is, if something has a key and a value, a dictionary is more appropriate than managing two lists. Similarly, if many variables are created instead of using a list, then it's improper code writing.
- 5 pts: Full points
- 0: pts No points
</criteria>

### Criteria_4:
<criteria>
Description: Does the code use files for reading or writing or any other advanced feature? If files are not applicable for the project, this criteria may be satisfied by graph generation, modules, python files, or other advanced features too.	
- 10 pts: Full points If file reading or other alternative advanced feature (like multiple modules, graphing, data analysis) is used appropriately in the code.
- 5 pts: Partial points Attempted to use files or other advanced feature but improper use/did not succeed fully.
- 0 pts: No points	
</criteria>

### Criteria_5:
<criteria>
Description: Is the code properly documented? Comments on key lines in the code and/or docstrings for functions.
- 5 pts: Full points if at least 5 commented lines or other text is present in the code
- 0 pts: No points If no comments or docstrings are provided.	
</criteria>

### Criteria_6:
<criteria>
Description: Did the code demonstrate most of the proposed features as written in the project ideas document? If most of the features are not demonstrated, check whether other equivalent (or new) features were implemented.	
- 25 pts: Full points If most of the features are successfully demonstrated (as seen from the code and its execution)
- 20 pts: Almost all features Almost all of the features for the project are demonstrated successfully.
- 15 pts: Half partial points Half of the proposed features are demonstrated successfully or some features are incorrectly implemented. The code implements a very basic set of features of the project.
- 10 pts: Partial points If only one feature is implemented and/or project is not significant work.
- 0 pts: No Marks
</criteria>

### Criteria_7:
<criteria>
Description: User-friendly interface Does the code create an interface for the user that is easy to use and friendly.

### Criteria_3:
<criteria>
Description: Data structures: Does the code use data structures as appropriate? Data structures discussed in the course are: strings, lists, and dictionaries. Grade whether the data structure that the code used is appropriate for that application. That is, if something has a key and a value, a dictionary is more appropriate than managing two lists. Similarly, if many variables are created instead of using a list, then it's improper code writing.

### Response:"
"### Instruction: You are a diligent grading assistant for a Computer Science teacher. Your task is to read and analyze the Python code between <code> and </code> tags. Evaluate the code according to the criteria provided between <criteria> and </criteria> tags. Before evaluating, carefully review the CodeDescription provided between <description> and </description> tags to understand the purpose and context of the project. For each criterion, always assess the logic of the code, even if it does not run or contains errors, and provide both a score and detailed feedback explaining the reason for that score. After addressing all criteria, conclude by listing all individual scores in a summary. Ensure your feedback is thorough and covers any key points or potential improvements relevant to each criterion.

### CodeDescription: 
<description>
Ask the user to choose a city and fruit tree from the provided list to calculate if it would thrive there depending on the USDA's hardiness zones, average rainfall, and average temperature. Also include if a plant should be regularly watered if there isn't enough rainfall. Use two text files, one including all of the city's information and one including all of the plant's information.
</description>

### Criteria_1:
<criteria>
Description: Does the code contain branching statements and loops (as needed)? Branching using if-else and loops for repetitive execution of tasks are two of the most central elements of any Python code. So, all project code submissions must contain at least one if statement and one for / while statement.	
- 15 pts: Full points If the criteria is satisfied.
-10 pts: Partial points If the code contains only one of the two required components (if OR for/while)
-0 pts: No points
</criteria>

### Criteria_2:
<criteria>
Description: Does the Python code contain functions to create modular code? Functions are important to create modular tasks to reduce the redundancy in the code and for independent testing.	
- 10 pts: Full points If the code contains at least one function that is properly formatted and makes sense for the project.	
- 5 pts: Partial points If the code contains improper use of functions (or modular code is clear from files or other means).
- 0 pts: No points		
</criteria>

### Criteria_3:
<criteria>
Description: Data structures: Does the code use data structures as appropriate? Data structures discussed in the course are: strings, lists, and dictionaries. Grade whether the data structure that the code used is appropriate for that application. That is, if something has a key and a value, a dictionary is more appropriate than managing two lists. Similarly, if many variables are created instead of using a list, then it's improper code writing.
- 5 pts: Full points
- 0: pts No points
</criteria>

### Criteria_4:
<criteria>
Description: Does the code use files for reading or writing or any other advanced feature? If files are not applicable for the project, this criteria may be satisfied by graph generation, modules, python files, or other advanced features too.	
- 10 pts: Full points If file reading or other alternative advanced feature (like multiple modules, graphing, data analysis) is used appropriately in the code.
- 5 pts: Partial points Attempted to use files or other advanced feature but improper use/did not succeed fully.
- 0 pts: No points	
</criteria>

### Criteria_5:
<criteria>
Description: Is the code properly documented? Comments on key lines in the code and/or docstrings for functions.
- 5 pts: Full points if at least 5 commented lines or other text is present in the code
- 0 pts: No points If no comments or docstrings are provided.	
</criteria>

### Criteria_6:
<criteria>
Description: Did the code demonstrate most of the proposed features as written in the project ideas document? If most of the features are not demonstrated, check whether other equivalent (or new) features were implemented.	
- 25 pts: Full points If most of the features are successfully demonstrated (as seen from the code and its execution)
- 20 pts: Almost all features Almost all of the features for the project are demonstrated successfully.
- 15 pts: Half partial points Half of the proposed features are demonstrated successfully or some features are incorrectly implemented. The code implements a very basic set of features of the project.
- 10 pts: Partial points If only one feature is implemented and/or project is not significant work.
- 0 pts: No Marks
</criteria>

### Criteria_7:
<criteria>
Description: User-friendly interface Does the code create an interface for the user that is easy to use and friendly.	
- 10 pts: Full points
- 5 pts: Partial points If some user-messages are unhelpful
- 0 pts: No Marks

So, all project code submissions must contain at least one if statement and one for / while statement.	
- 15 pts: Full points If the criteria is satisfied.
-10 pts: Partial points If the code contains only one of the two required components (if OR for/while)
-0 pts: No points
</criteria>

### Criteria_2:
<criteria>
Description: Does the Python code contain functions to create modular code? Functions are important to create modular tasks to reduce the redundancy in the code and for independent testing.	
- 10 pts: Full points If the code contains at least one function that is properly formatted and makes sense for the project.	
- 5 pts: Partial points If the code contains improper use of functions (or modular code is clear from files or other means).
- 0 pts: No points		
</criteria>

### Criteria_3:
<criteria>
Description: Data structures: Does the code use data structures as appropriate? Data structures discussed in the course are: strings, lists, and dictionaries. Grade whether the data structure that the code used is appropriate for that application. That is, if something has a key and a value, a dictionary is more appropriate than managing two lists. Similarly, if many variables are created instead of using a list, then it's improper code writing.
- 5 pts: Full points
- 0: pts No points
</criteria>

### Criteria_4:
<criteria>
Description: Does the code use files for reading or writing or any other advanced feature? If files are not applicable for the project, this criteria may be satisfied by graph generation, modules, python files, or other advanced features too.	
- 10 pts: Full points If file reading or other alternative advanced feature (like multiple modules, graphing, data analysis) is used appropriately in the code.
- 5 pts: Partial points Attempted to use files or other advanced feature but improper use/did not succeed fully.
- 0 pts: No points	
</criteria>

### Criteria_5:
<criteria>
Description: Is the code properly documented? Comments on key lines in the code and/or docstrings for functions.
- 5 pts: Full points if at least 5 commented lines or other text is present in the code
- 0 pts: No points If no comments or docstrings are provided.	
</criteria>

### Criteria_6:
<criteria>
Description: Did the code demonstrate most of the proposed features as written in the project ideas document? If most of the features are not demonstrated, check whether other equivalent (or new) features were implemented.	
- 25 pts: Full points If most of the features are successfully demonstrated (as seen from the code and its execution)
- 20 pts: Almost all features Almost all of the features for the project are demonstrated successfully.
- 15 pts: Half partial points Half of the proposed features are demonstrated successfully or some features are incorrectly implemented. The code implements a very basic set of features of the project.
- 10 pts: Partial points If only one feature is implemented and/or project is not significant work.
- 0 pts: No Marks
</criteria>

### Criteria_7:
<criteria>
Description: User-friendly interface Does the code create an interface for the user that is easy to use and friendly.	
- 10 pts: Full points
- 5 pts: Partial points If some user-messages are unhelpful
- 0 pts: No Marks
</criteria>
