	Developer: Clark Gamboa
	This project aims to create a full on Fibonacci Sequence through a few methods.


	Changes: 
		10/1/23: 
			- The start of coding this thing.
		
		10/8/23:
			- Created functions to output the user_options and user_options2 dictionaries (just to make O/I Code look a little cleaner)
			- HowItWorks() function now utilizes the use of a .txt file insteead of an ungodly amount of print() statements.
			- Added 2nd generation method option: FS_n_Numbers() function generates "Fn" numbers of Fibonacci numbers 
		
		10/15/23: 
				- ALL the functions for this code are now in a COMPLETELY SEPERATE .py file.
					(This allows me to test the functions seperately from the main code main code being THIS .py file)
				- Decided to utilize Try and Except blocks to check if the user input is a numerical value or not. 
					(Reason: First time using try and except blocks, so really I'm experementing with how they work)
				- Utilization of python's logging module.
					(Allows me to check if everything is working smoothly without having to use print() all the time. Especially with the math stuff)
				- Utilization of python's os module.
				- New Generation option! Dividing numbers in the Fibonnaci Sequence to create the Golden Ratio!
				- New Menue Option: Explanation of the Golden Ratio
				- Another Generation option: Multiplying Phi to create FBS

		10/18/23:
				- Imported python's time module.
					(You can now see how long it takes to for the program to generate the sequence)
				- New Option: "CLEAR LOG FILE"
					(Option is merely there to clear the log file if it gets too big, as in it gets into the Gigabytes)
				- Another Try and Except block for OverflowError.
					(Deals with if the user decides to generate too many numbers the program cant handle.)
				- Renamed the functions so that their names are more clear to understand.
				- Moved a few functions back to the main file.

		10/29/23:
				- The project is practically finished.
				- Minor Change: Removed 'mymodules' folder and put its contents into the main file.
					(For easier grading)
				- Will try to polsih code so its easier to read and understand.
